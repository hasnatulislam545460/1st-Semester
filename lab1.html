        <p align="justify">
        A hobby is voluntary work done for fun in your  spare time. Many popular hobbies include stamp collecting, coin collecting, photography, and so on. My favourite hobby, however, is gardening. I began when I was ten years old. I own a small plot of land next to our house. I cultivate gardening there. Every day, I spend an hour gardening. After returning from my morning walk, I go to my garden with a spade and a bucket of water. I prepare the     soil, prune the plants, and water them. I also use insecticides and fertilisers.

        My heart leaps with joy when I see the plants swaying in the wind. I feel heavenly pleasure as I watch them grow day by day. I chose this hobby because it provides me with not only enjoyment but also enough physical exercise to keep my body in good shape.

        I’m having some difficulties with my gardening. Entellus frequently eat flowers and destroy plants, despite my best efforts to scare them away. Gardening gives me both pleasure and health. Every afternoon, I spend an hour in my garden, watching the buds sprout and the branches sway in the breeze. Although a hobby is primarily for enjoyment rather than profit, mine combines the two. My mother regards it favourably because a portion of my garden serves as a kitchen garden. A man’s hobby is an indicator of his personality, and I believe my hobby reflects my personality.
