            Everybody has an aim in life. Aimless life is a worthless life. Who doesn’t have aim, they just live because they have to live. Aimless life is like a traveler who does not know the destination and direction of a journey. Different people have different aims, some peoples’ aim is to be wealthy, powerful, some want satisfaction and fame in their life, but my aim in life is to become a computer engineer. To be an engineer, I have to face lots of difficulties but I have strong determination to achieve my goal. There are multiple reasons and importance of my choice to be an engineer. When I was a small kid, I saw a man using a computer in Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal and it’s made me wonder and then I said to him, “can I touch it?” He didn’t give me a chance to touch the computer. This thing affects my life and I felt that one day I’ll be an engineer. 
            The reason to choose this aim is; this profession is noble in the society. I can earn good money and live in the prestigious life and fulfill my desires. It doesn’t mean that I am a money minded, greedy man and I run after money, when I become an engineer then I’ll help poor people.
